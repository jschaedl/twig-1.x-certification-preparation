# Twig 1.x Certification Preparation

I recently passed the [Twig 1.x Certification](https://certification.symfony.com/exams/twig.html) provided by SensioLabs and wanted to share a small guide, which i created while preparing for the exam:

- [01-topics](https://github.com/jschaedl/twig-1.x-certification-preparation/blob/main/01-topics.md): This document lists all the important documentation pages, which you should read in order to prepare for the exam.
- [02-concepts](https://github.com/jschaedl/twig-1.x-certification-preparation/blob/main/02-concepts.md): Here you will find a brief summary of Twig's basics concepts.
- [03-important-tags](https://github.com/jschaedl/twig-1.x-certification-preparation/blob/main/02-important-tags.md): This list describes the most important tags.
